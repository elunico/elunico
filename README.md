# Hi, I'm Tom (elunico) ðŸ‘‹

I'm a High School Teacher and the Technology Coordinator for my school. I am passionate about helping students discover the power of technology. I have hands-on experience with Java, Kotlin, Python, C, C++, JavaScript, and Swift, and I enjoy building with frameworks and tools like JavaFX, SwiftUI, AppKit, Flask, Xcode, IntelliJ, and VSCode. I currently teach AP CS P, an Introductory Python Course, Physics, and Engineering. 

**Favorite Projects:**
- [Custom Video Speed for YouTube](https://github.com/elunico/custom-youtube-speed)
- [JPEdit](https://github.com/el unico/JPEdit)
- [SocDraw](https://github.com/elunico/SocDraw)

Besides programming, I have a strong interest in typography and fonts. I use Menlo (or variants) for almost all the coding that I do and I strongly believe it is the best font for programming.

Thanks for stopping by!
